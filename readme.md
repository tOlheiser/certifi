# Certifi

Certifi is an app built as a capstone project for my Interactive Design & Technology program. It gives the ability for the user to upload and view their safety tickets. This is especially useful when you need to present your tickets to a safety official, or to an employer. 

**Legacy Build**
* Plain old CSS using floats
* Vanilla JS
* MySQL
* PHP

## What I'll be Using
* CSS Modules and Flexbox for the layout
* React Hooks & React Router
* MongoDB
* Node.js

**Tooling**
* PostCSS & CSS Modules
* NPM
* Parcel.js
* ESLint & Prettier

## Views

* **User** - Upload tickets. Get notified when a ticket is expiring, or when your company releases a job posting (giving the user the ability to recommend one of their friends for the job). There will be a profile settings view, basically detailing how private you choose to make your profile, as well as modify notifications.
* **Employee Management** - Notifications of employee's expiring tickets, and ideally the ability to enroll them in courses. 
* **Job Board** - List of jobs. You can click on the company that posted the job to view their profile, other positions they have listed, and who works for them. Gives the job poster the ability to filter out users who don't have the certifications.
